# The Wrong Room

### Built with Llama

### Improved using Qwen

Welcome to the Norne Corporation's Private Investigation Division! Corruption is afoot, and code words must be extracted. Suspects will be routed to your office, and you must systematically break them down through manipulation, bribery, promises of companionship, or good ol' fashioned torture.

Suspects are powered by a custom LLM that is finetuned to produce engaging dialogues and runs entirely locally. No data leaves your device. It is small and efficient and will work on any device with 8GB or more of RAM and a relatively modern CPU. Automatically will use CUDA if available, or the GPU on Apple Silicon macs. This means that there is unlimited dialogue in the game - every interaction is new, and you can take the conversation in any direction you please. Speech to text and text to speech are additionally included, so you can both talk to the suspects and hear their voices talk back.

Happy interrogating! Remember, the security of Norne depends on you.
